### Minor Changes

- 482411e: Add new icon variants and update existing icons

## 5.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 892575f: fix: prevent tsup from deleting metadata files during build

  The tsup build step was cleaning the entire dist folder including icons.meta.json, causing all icons to be marked as "new" with the current version. Changed tsup to not clean the dist folder and added manual cleanup of only build artifacts (js/ts files) before running tsup, preserving metadata files so version history is correctly maintained.

## 5.0.3

### Patch Changes

- eeda95f: fix: correct metadata lookup to preserve icon version history during builds

  Fixed a bug where the build script wasn't properly looking up existing icon metadata, causing all icons to be incorrectly marked as "new" with the current version instead of preserving their historical `versionAdded` values. The lookup now correctly uses name+variant matching to preserve version history.

## 5.0.2

### Patch Changes

- cdb1905: Fix metadata component names to reflect wrapper component API. The icons.meta.json now correctly shows the wrapper component name (e.g., "AiIcon") instead of variant-specific names (e.g., "AiIconBold"), since users access icons via the variant prop like `<AiIcon variant="bold">`.

## 5.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 5b13d1a: Fix icon version metadata for more accurate version tracking history

## 5.0.0

### Major Changes

- be3d230: **BREAKING CHANGE: All icon components now have "Icon" suffix**

  To prevent naming conflicts with user components, all icon component names now include an "Icon" suffix. This aligns with industry standards from Material-UI Icons, Heroicons, and other popular icon libraries.

  **Migration:**

  Update all icon imports to use the new naming convention:

  ```tsx
  // Before
  import { Search, Heart, Home, User } from "stera-icons";

  // After
  import { SearchIcon, HeartIcon, HomeIcon, UserIcon } from "stera-icons";
  ```

  **Variant naming:**

  - Regular: `SearchIcon`, `HeartIcon`, etc.
  - Bold: `SearchIconBold`, `HeartIconBold`, etc.
  - Filled: `SearchIconFilled`, `HeartIconFilled`, etc.

  **Benefits:**

  - ✅ No naming conflicts with existing components in your codebase
  - ✅ Follows industry-standard naming conventions
  - ✅ More explicit and self-documenting
  - ✅ Better developer experience with clearer intent
