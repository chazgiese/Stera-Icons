"stera-icons": patch

Align dynamic icon documentation with lucide-react approach. Remove misleading icon picker example and clarify that dynamic imports are for small numbers of icons from external data sources, not bulk loading scenarios. Add "use client" directive for Next.js App Router compatibility.
